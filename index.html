 <h2>Operating System </h2>
 <h4>by D M Dhamdhere</h4>
 <br>
 <p>The main objective of a ﬁrst course in operating systems is to develop an understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques of operating systems. Most of the students are already exposed to diverse in formation on operating systems as a result of practical exposure to operating systems and literature on the Internet; such students have a lot of information but few concepts about operating systems. This situation makes teaching of operating systems concepts a challenging task because it is necessary to retroﬁt some concepts to the information possessed by these students without boring them, yet do it in a manner that introduces concepts to ﬁrst-time learners of operating systems without intimidating them. This book presents operating system concepts and techniques in a manner that incorporates these requirements.

 <h2>KARMA</h2>
 <h4>by Sadhguru</h4>
 <br>
 <p>A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system which seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves. This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living.
Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to craft our destinies.

 <h2>DEATH </h2>
 <h4>by Sadhguru</h4>
 <br>
 <p>Death is a taboo in most societies in the world. But what if we have got this completely wrong? What if death was not the catastrophe it is made out to be but an essential aspect of life, rife with spiritual possibilities for transcendence? For the first time, someone is saying just that.
In this unique treatise-like exposition, Sadhguru dwells extensively upon his inner experience as he expounds on the more profound aspects of death that are rarely spoken about. From a practical standpoint, he elaborates on what preparations one can make for one's death, how best we can assist someone who is dying and how we can continue to support their journey even after death.
Whether a believer or not, a devotee or an agnostic, an accomplished seeker or a simpleton, this is truly a book for all those who shall die!
